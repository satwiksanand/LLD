# Abstract Factory Design

abstract factory design as the name suggests is an abstraction of factory design pattern.
as a factory design pattern allows us to create a generic factory of one or more than one type of object of similar types, in a same way the abstract factory design pattern allows us to 
maintain a lot of factories, which is one level above the abstraction of factory design pattern.
